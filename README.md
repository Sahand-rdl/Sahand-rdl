## Hi there 👋

My name is **Sahand**, and I am currently studying computer science at RWTH-Aachen University! 🖋️

My main focus is on learning machine learning techniques and trying to delve deeper into deep learning! 👨🏻‍💻
I am working on my thesis in NLP, playing with some embedding models, and huge multilingual datasets on some pretty powerful supercomputers... 📝
I'm trying to apply what I've learned in theory during my studies into solving practical problems, hopefully conducting meaningful research. 📊📈

That's pretty much it! 😆👋

- fun fact: Sahand is the name of an inactive volcano in northwestern Iran, and it means strong, firm, and established! The easiest way to remember the name, is Sa + ✋ = Sahand!
